Deployed on railway for about a month through their free service. Have not implemented a backend to store individual users data. (Mostly looking at mySQL)

**How it works**
There are query links through UCI's public class registration links. Whenever a user wants to add a class to their watchlist, it saves the unique link to their account and scrapes/refreshes the page to notice any changes every 5 minutes. When the script detects a change, it pushes notifications to user and updates their position on waitlist.

**Automatic notification for users when you move up or down on the waitlist**
